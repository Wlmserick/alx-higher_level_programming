# Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

## Overview

This README.md provides a summary of Python object-relational mapping (ORM), covering its definition, usage, and key concepts.

## Definition

Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that enables developers to work with relational databases using an object-oriented approach. ORM frameworks provide tools and libraries for mapping database tables to Python classes, and vice versa, allowing developers to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs such as classes, objects, and methods.

## Usage

ORM frameworks in Python, such as SQLAlchemy and Django ORM, simplify database interactions by abstracting away the complexities of SQL queries and database management. Developers can define Python classes that represent database tables and use ORM features to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations without writing SQL queries explicitly.

## Key Concepts

### Models

- **Definition**: Models are Python classes that represent database tables. Each model class typically corresponds to a single table in the database.
- **Attributes**: Class attributes in models represent table columns, and each instance of the model class represents a row in the table.
- **Relationships**: Models can define relationships between tables using foreign keys, allowing developers to establish connections and navigate between related objects.

### Queries

- **CRUD Operations**: ORM frameworks provide methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting database records using Python syntax.
- **Query Objects**: Queries are represented as objects that encapsulate database operations, allowing developers to chain methods to filter, sort, and manipulate data.

### Migrations

- **Definition**: Migrations are scripts generated by ORM frameworks to manage changes to the database schema over time.
- **Schema Changes**: Migrations handle schema alterations, such as creating or modifying tables, adding or removing columns, and defining relationships.

## Benefits

- **Abstraction**: ORM abstracts away the complexities of database management, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than SQL syntax.
- **Portability**: ORM frameworks provide a layer of abstraction that makes it easier to switch between different database systems without rewriting code.
- **Productivity**: ORM simplifies database interactions and reduces development time by providing high-level abstractions and tools for common tasks.

## Considerations

- **Performance**: ORM abstraction may introduce overhead compared to writing raw SQL queries, particularly for complex operations or performance-critical applications.
- **Learning Curve**: ORM frameworks have their own syntax and conventions, requiring developers to learn how to use them effectively.
