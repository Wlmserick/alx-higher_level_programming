## Introduction

This assignment provides an overview of fundamental JavaScript concepts, including variables, data types, control flow, loops, functions, and more.

## Why JavaScript Programming is Amazing

JavaScript is an amazing programming language because:

- It's versatile and can be used for both frontend and backend development.
- It's the language of the web, enabling dynamic and interactive web applications.
- It has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for building robust and scalable applications.
- It's constantly evolving, with new features and updates being introduced regularly.
- It has a large and active community of developers, providing support and resources for learning and growth.

## How to Run a JavaScript Script

To run a JavaScript script:

1. Create a new file with a `.js` extension.
2. Write your JavaScript code in the file.
3. Open the terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing your JavaScript file.
5. Run the script using a JavaScript runtime environment like Node.js:

   ```
   node script.js
   ```

## How to Create Variables and Constants

To create variables and constants in JavaScript:

- **Variables**: Use the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords followed by the variable name and optionally initialize it with a value.
- **Constants**: Use the `const` keyword to define a constant variable that cannot be reassigned.

## Differences Between var, const, and let

- `var`: Function-scoped variable that can be redeclared and reassigned.
- `const`: Block-scoped constant variable that cannot be reassigned.
- `let`: Block-scoped variable that can be reassigned but not redeclared.

## Data Types Available in JavaScript

JavaScript has the following data types:

- **Primitive Types**: `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, and `symbol`.
- **Complex Types**: `object` (including arrays and functions).

## How to Use Control Flow Statements

- **if Statement**: Use the `if` statement to execute a block of code if a condition is true.
- **if ... else Statement**: Use the `if ... else` statement to execute different blocks of code based on different conditions.

## How to Use Comments

Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments to add explanations or notes to your code.

## How to Affect Values to Variables

Use the assignment operator (`=`) to assign values to variables.

## How to Use Loops

- **while Loop**: Use the `while` loop to repeatedly execute a block of code while a condition is true.
- **for Loop**: Use the `for` loop to execute a block of code a specified number of times.

## How to Use break and continue Statements

- **break Statement**: Use the `break` statement to terminate a loop prematurely.
- **continue Statement**: Use the `continue` statement to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue to the next iteration.

## What is a Function and How to Use Functions

A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. To define a function, use the `function` keyword followed by the function name, parameters (if any), and function body. To call a function, simply use the function name followed by parentheses.

## What Does a Function That Does Not Use any Return Statement Return

A function that does not use any `return` statement returns `undefined` by default.

## Scope of Variables

Variables in JavaScript have either function scope (if declared with `var`) or block scope (if declared with `let` or `const`). Global variables are accessible throughout the entire program, while local variables are accessible only within the block or function where they are declared.

## Arithmetic Operators and How to Use Them

JavaScript has arithmetic operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus respectively.

## How to Manipulate Dictionary

In JavaScript, a dictionary is typically represented as an object. You can manipulate dictionaries (objects) by adding, modifying, or deleting properties using dot notation or bracket notation.

## How to Import a File

In JavaScript, you can import files using modules. To import a file, use the `import` keyword followed by the module path and optionally the specific members to import.
