# JavaScript Objects, Scopes, and Closures

## Overview

This README.md provides a summary of JavaScript objects, scopes, and closures, covering their definitions, usage, and key concepts.

## JavaScript Objects

- **Definition**: Objects in JavaScript are complex data types that can store collections of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or symbol) and each value can be any data type (including other objects, functions, and arrays).
- **Usage**: Objects are widely used in JavaScript for organizing and manipulating data, representing real-world entities, and building complex data structures.

## Scopes in JavaScript

- **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside of any function or block have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
- **Local Scope**: Variables declared inside a function or block have local scope and can only be accessed within that function or block.
- **Function Scope**: JavaScript uses function scope, meaning variables declared within a function are only accessible within that function.

## Closures in JavaScript

- **Definition**: A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. It allows a function to access variables from its outer scope even after the outer scope has exited.
- **Usage**: Closures are commonly used to create private variables, implement modules, and maintain state in asynchronous code.
